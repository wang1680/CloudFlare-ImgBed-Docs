# Update Logs

## Recent Updates

Add Features:
- Added a “Reset announcement read status” option to announcement settings. Users who already acknowledged an announcement will see it again on their next visit after its content changes or an administrator manually refreshes it
- Announcements are now marked as acknowledged only after the user clicks “Got it”, recording the acknowledgement time and announcement version while remaining compatible with the legacy first-visit marker

Fix Bugs:
- Fixed intermittent hover flicker and hit-target jitter in the admin top page switcher while images, tables, or charts are loading. Menu visibility is now managed explicitly, with a grouped option animation and a shared hover highlight

Optimization:
- Synchronized the page switcher panel, option group, arrow, and hover slider at roughly 300ms, preserving the glass-style expansion while making the animation more cohesive
- Centered the current-directory-empty state in the dashboard content area and aligned user management table spacing from the top header on desktop and mobile

Security:
- Enhance target URL validation for the fetchRes interface
- Upgrade dependencies to improve security

## 2026.07.11

Fix Bugs:
- Fixed intermittent hover flicker and hit-target jitter in the admin top page switcher while images, tables, or charts are loading. Menu visibility is now managed explicitly, with a grouped option animation and a shared hover highlight

Optimization:
- Synchronized the page switcher panel, option group, arrow, and hover slider at roughly 300ms, preserving the glass-style expansion while making the animation more cohesive
- Centered the current-directory-empty state in the dashboard content area and aligned user management table spacing from the top header on desktop and mobile

## 2026.07.01

Optimization:
- Refined upload page title, toolbars, and quick action capsule details with consistent light/dark hover states, borders, shadows, and mobile edge alignment
- Unified dashboard breadcrumb controls, checkboxes, view toggle, and breadcrumb interactions with a lighter glass-style treatment, and extracted a reusable dashboard checkbox component
- Made dashboard mobile card view use a two-column layout, with more compact list view, pagination, loading skeletons, and action buttons
- Added swipe-based page navigation on dashboard mobile content areas and hid the pagination prev/next buttons to reduce small-screen obstruction

## 2026.06.30

Optimization:
- Integrated the dashboard top page switcher into the current option, allowing users to hover or click to switch between file management, user management, system settings, and upload page
- Refined the dashboard page switcher hover stability, dark menu background, current option surface, and mobile spacing for a more consistent interface
- Added dedicated theme variables for the page switcher, with a lighter candy color and soft pink-blue gradient treatment for the current option, including improved dark-mode color quality
- Added a subtle zoom-in effect to multi-image background carousels for smoother background transitions

## 2026.06.29

Add Features:
- Added a floating batch action bar for dashboard multi-select, showing the selected count and quick actions for copy, download, move, tag management, blacklist, whitelist, delete, and clearing selection
- Redesigned the upload page quick toolbar as an expandable capsule, with upload settings available directly and secondary actions expanding upward

Optimization:
- Switched the upload and login title font to Pacifico, and refined title colors, hover underline, and crayon-style hover writing effects for light and dark modes
- Refined the upload list toolbar, quick toolbar spacing, animations, and mobile placement for a lighter interaction
- Moved the dashboard select-current-page control to the breadcrumb row, added breadcrumb spacing, and softened card preview hover scaling
- Added async image decoding and deferred off-screen rendering for dashboard previews to reduce jank when many high-resolution images are shown
- Suppressed card and list hover effects while drag-selecting dashboard items to reduce visual noise
- Extracted the dashboard batch action bar into a standalone component for easier maintenance

## 2026.06.15

Optimization:
- Added a generic Worker Cache layer to the Workers deployment adapter based on business `Cache-Control` responses. Public `GET/HEAD` responses are checked in cache first, and cache misses run the original business route before storing responses with `public, max-age/s-maxage`
- Range requests now try to use an existing complete cached response first; cache misses pass through to the business response and do not store 206 partial responses, preventing partial content from polluting full-file cache entries

Security:
- Changed the directory tree and tag autocomplete APIs to `private` caching, preserving short browser caching while preventing authenticated APIs from entering the shared Workers cache

## 2026.06.14

Add Features:
- Added IP Geolocation Query settings under System Settings → Security Settings → Upload Management, supporting enable/disable, custom API request parameters, and the `{ip}` placeholder for passing the upload IP
- IP Geolocation Query now supports JSON response field paths; the backend joins field values in order and writes the result to file metadata `UploadAddress`

## 2026.06.12

Add Features:
- Added `publicUrl` to successful Upload API responses. When a default URL prefix is set, basic uploads and chunked-upload merge return this public access link

## 2026.06.09

Security:
- Admin login, user login, and session checks now return 503 when security settings cannot be loaded, preventing fallback to an empty default authentication config
- Session max-age settings are now normalized on the backend; timestamp-like or out-of-range values fall back to 14 days to avoid Cloudflare KV `expirationTtl` range errors

Optimization:
- Added frontend validation for user and admin session max age in System Settings > Security Settings, restricting values to 1-3650 days

Fix Bugs:
- Fixed admin login returning HTTP 500 when an abnormal millisecond timestamp was used as the Cloudflare KV `expirationTtl`

## 2026.06.08

Fix Bugs:
- Fixed chunked uploads failing when some browsers cannot detect a file MIME type and the frontend sends an empty `originalFileType`; the upload form now falls back to `application/octet-stream`

## 2026.06.05

Optimization:
- Added fallback channel matching based on unique identity fields stored in legacy metadata, allowing files to keep resolving to the current Telegram, S3/R2, Discord, HuggingFace, or WebDAV channel configuration after a channel is renamed
- Added channel-name immutability hints in channel settings and disabled channel-name editing to prevent breaking the association between uploaded files and their channel configuration

Fix Bugs:
- Fixed large admin file lists stopping before all pages were appended even when later load-more requests succeeded
- Changed channel deletion confirmation into a risk warning that clearly states files associated with the deleted channel may become inaccessible

## 2026.06.03

Optimization:
- Reduced persisted file metadata for S3, Telegram, Discord, HuggingFace, WebDAV, and related channels by no longer storing fields that can be read from the current channel configuration
- Management file details now dynamically enrich S3Location, S3CdnFileUrl, HfFileUrl, WebDAVPublicUrl, and similar display fields from the current channel configuration, so displayed links refresh after config changes
- File read, delete, move, and rename operations now resolve credentials through the current channel configuration; legacy Telegram/TelegramNew records without `ChannelName` fall back to `Telegram_env`

Security:
- Management metadata, tag, allow/block list, move, rename, and backup restore write paths now consistently remove sensitive and config-derived fields, preventing old backups or legacy records from writing credentials back

Fix Bugs:
- Fixed file details still showing stale S3Location or CDN links after changing S3 endpoint/CDN configuration
- Fixed S3 move or rename failures potentially moving the database record even when the remote S3 operation failed

## 2026.06.02

Add Features:
- Added `/upload/huggingface/completeMultipart` to proxy HuggingFace LFS multipart completion for large direct uploads
- HuggingFace direct upload URL generation now rewrites multipart completion URLs to an internal endpoint, enabling multipart completion in Cloudflare Workers deployments

Optimization:
- Unified WebDAV credential resolution into the shared channel credential flow, so read, delete, move, and rename operations use the same configuration source

Security:
- Management file list, batch list, custom file list, and metadata APIs now filter sensitive S3, Telegram, Discord, HuggingFace, and WebDAV credentials from returned metadata
- File read, delete, move, and rename operations now prefer current channel configuration for credentials, reducing the need to store or expose credentials in file metadata
- `WebDAVBaseUrl` in metadata now strips URL userinfo to avoid leaking usernames or passwords through management API responses

Fix Bugs:
- Fixed HuggingFace direct upload URL requests requiring `fileType`; files without a MIME type now fall back to `application/octet-stream`
- Improved HuggingFace multipart completion target and parts validation so invalid requests return 400 instead of 500
- Fixed WebDAV public URL reads changing the original 404/403 status into 500 when the WebDAV API fallback also failed

## 2026.05.30

Fix Bugs:
- Fixed HuggingFace file `HEAD` responses returning `Content-Length: 0`; the handler now uses uploaded metadata (`FileSizeBytes`) to report the actual file size, improving browser and player media probing

## 2026.05.25

Add Features:
- Added an upload trend line chart to the system status page, showing uploads from the last 7 days by default
- Upload trends can be grouped by channel type or channel name, with a total uploads line
- Upload trends support date range filtering with a single-month calendar dialog; click twice to select start/end dates or manually enter the date range
- Dashboard file rename dialog now supports confirming with Enter

Optimization:
- Enhanced the `indexinfo` API with upload trend statistics, using linear aggregation into date buckets and capped point/series counts to avoid high CPU usage on the status page

## 2026.05.06

Fix Bugs:
- Fixed duplicate `Content-Length` response headers from the Docker native Node server when accessing `/random` through a reverse proxy, which could cause Nginx / Cloudflare to return 502

## 2026.05.01

Security:
- WebDAV internal calls now use a dedicated API Token instead of admin password Basic Auth, eliminating the risk of password hash leakage

Fix Bugs:
- Fixed off-by-one error in Docker deployment `[[path]].js` catch-all route matching, causing `/dav/` and `/file/` root paths to return 404
- Fixed WebDAV PROPFIND always reporting file size as 0 (was reading non-existent `File-Size` field, changed to `FileSizeBytes`)
- Fixed WebDAV PROPFIND file href missing `/dav` prefix, preventing clients from downloading files
- Fixed WebDAV PROPFIND missing `getcontenttype` property, preventing Alist and other clients from identifying file types and showing previews

## 2026.04.29

Security:
- Admin file previews no longer trust `from=admin` or same-origin Referer, and now require a verified admin session before allowing admin previews
- Manage APIs now get a default non-cacheable response header to prevent browser or CDN caching from causing stale state after GET-style management operations
- Reduced mutation response payloads for manage APIs to avoid returning unnecessary metadata or sensitive data from blocklist, tag, and API Token update endpoints

Optimization:
- Optimized data loading on the admin user management page: the user list API now aggregates IP summaries in a single pass and returns summary rows only, while per-user file records are lazy-loaded on row expansion to reduce Worker CPU usage and response payload size

Fix Bugs:
- Fixed blocklist/whitelist toggles in the admin panel potentially returning cached old responses, which could show success without updating the actual state

## 2026.04.28

Add Features:
- Added WebDAV storage channel, allowing third-party WebDAV services to be used as upload backends with upload, read, delete, move, rename, and channel-list support

Security:
- Session storage keys migrated to the `manage@session@` prefix to prevent session data from entering the file index and backup exports

Fix Bugs:
- Fixed D1 adapter routing for `manage@` configuration keys so blocklists, sessions, and other settings no longer get written to the files table
- Fixed D1 settings backup reads so `manage@` settings data can be listed correctly

## 2026.04.27

Refactor:
- Reworked login page keyboard avoidance: replaced media query approach with visualViewport API to detect virtual keyboard, fixing false triggers on narrow screens without a keyboard
- Optimized mobile login card spacing, reduced input height and field gaps for better visibility when keyboard is open

## 2026.04.24

## 2026.04.17

Security:
